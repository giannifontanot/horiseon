# Horiseon Social Solution Services 
## This page uses modern semantic web elements. 

- Originaly, this webpage was developed not using semantic tags.
- In this situation the page was not ready to be indexed by a modern Search Engine.
- By refactoring the webpage using semantic tags it will be easier for modern Search Engines to deliver it as a search result.
- I learned to use the semantic tags to develop a modern webpage. Before learning semantic tags I was used to write regular HTML DIV tags, but now my pages are much more structured and ready for a better indexation.
